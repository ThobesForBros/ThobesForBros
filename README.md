# Hiyyyaaaa!!!! ✨

I'm **Thobes!** I use my online name pretty much everywhere — it means a lot to me & honestly, just feels right. ** I’m trying to be a bit more alive on GitHub lately, especially for projects I actually care about or want to support.

I’m a **pre‑med student** with a soft spot for **psychology, counseling, and all things brain‑vibes**, but STEM has always had me in a chokehold too. So, this space is kinda my playground — lighthearted, a little nerdy, and sprinkled with the same vibes as my Rei icon.

Feel free to poke around my work! I’m building things slowly but surely. :3
