# HiyaðŸ‘‹!

My name is Ayaan Umair, and I'm a student at the University of Texas at Dallas! I'm currently studying Electrical Engineering, but I do a lot! From the gym, skateboarding, and boxing to programming, 3D modeling, and research! I'll post anything here to keep everything in one place. I have a lot of social media accounts, so you should be able to find me on anything! I linked my Reddit and LinkedIn since they are more "professional" than others. My Reddit links the casual and professional accounts, so it's the gateway to my online life!

Have a lovely day, 
Ayaan U
