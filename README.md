# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ayaan Umair, and I'm a student at the University of Texas at Dallas! I'm currently studying Electrical Engineering, but I do a lot of stuff! From the gym, skateboarding, and boxing to programming, 3D modeling, and just research about stuff! I'll basically post literally anything here to keep everything in one place.
