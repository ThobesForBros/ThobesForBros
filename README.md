# HiyaðŸ‘‹!

My name is Ayaan Umair, and I'm a student at the University of Texas at Dallas! I'm studying Neuroscience & Psychology (Major/Minor), but I do a lot! From powerlifting, philosophy, programming, reading, cars, photography, and research! I'll post anything here to keep everything in one place. I have a lot of social media accounts, so you should be able to find me on anything! I linked my LinkedIn if you wanna look at it! 

Have a lovely day,
\
Ayaan U
