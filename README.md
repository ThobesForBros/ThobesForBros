# HiyaðŸ‘‹!

My name is Ayaan Umair, and I'm a student at the University of Texas at Dallas! I'm studying Electrical Engineering and Psychology, but I do a lot! From skateboarding and boxing to programming, reading, 3D modeling, and research! I'll post anything here to keep everything in one place. I have a lot of social media accounts, so you should be able to find me on anything! I linked my LinkedIn since they are more "professional" than others. 

Have a lovely day,
\
